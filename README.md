# 📊 1 – HR Attrition Dashboard  

## 1️⃣ User Story
Mr. Ryan, the Head of HR, wanted a comprehensive and interactive dashboard to analyze the company’s employees. The goal was to answer key HR questions about:
✅ Employee demographics (race, education, age, gender)
✅ Workforce size, attrition rate, and hiring trends
✅ Performance review timelines and satisfaction ratings
✅ Groups most affected by attrition and potential retention strategies

This dashboard allows executives to filter by department, gender, age group, year, and attrition status, providing both a high-level overview and the ability to drill down into detailed insights for better decision-making.
